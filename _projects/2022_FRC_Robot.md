Dedicated 5,500 hours leading a team of 40 students and actively promoted STEM education through 15 outreach initiatives.
Designed, fabricated, and iterated on two on-season and one off-season robots annually using CAD and machine tools.
Developed a custom inverted swerve drivetrain for protection, an 11” wheel tank drivetrain for rough terrain, a shooter capable of launching 16” balls, and tube-in-tube arm and 180° wrist subsystems for cone placement from any orientation.
Led rapid prototyping to build a trap mechanism in two months to enable a 150-lb robot to climb a chain and reach high scoring, and a belt-driven three-stage cascading climber to ascend four levels of elevated monkey bars using pneumatic.
Streamlined CAD workflow by 80% via version control/branching & wrote FeatureScripts to accelerate robot lightweighting.
Mentored rookie members and enhanced subsystems communication with structured timelines and design review sessions.
