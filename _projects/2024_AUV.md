Orion, developed for the 2024–2025 season, builds on the architectural foundations established by Sirius while refining key subsystems for greater reliability and integration.
Key components like the killswitch and GX sensor remain consolidated in the UHPV, while modular systems like the manipulator and hydrophones are redesigned for flexibility and ease of iteration. The new manipulator features a gear-driven, multi-material design for better adaptability, and updated battery pods improve layout and safety.
Overall, Orion emphasizes modularity, reliability, and streamlined design.
