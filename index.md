## About Me

![Profile Picture](assets/images/Catherine_Seo_Profile.jpg){: style="width:40vw; height:auto; display:block; margin: 0 auto;" }

Hello, my name is Catherine Seo, and I’m studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University with a strong interest in robotics. I’m originally from Texas, currently living in Idaho, and I’ve spent half of my life in South Korea.

When I picture the future of engineering, I imagine a world where deep space and the deep ocean are no longer mysteries, but rather mapped, understood, and transformed into safe places where people can live. Approximately 95% of the ocean remains unexplored due to environmental extremes and technological limitations. However,  just like how human curiosity drove Columbus to sail into the unknown and Steve Jobs to spark a digital revolution, I believe those same desires for knowledge will guide the next wave of discovery: underwater.

My dream is to develop affordable smart cities deep in the ocean, combining architectural robotics (human-centered systems) and underwater robotics. I want to become a chief marine engineer, managing projects, providing technical guidance, or even starting a startup that contributes to developing pressure-resistant structures and watertight cables. Being able to dream big is shaped by my open-mindedness and ambition.

I believe I’ll continue developing my skills in the future, just like I am now, whether that involves designing, manufacturing, or testing underwater robots. Also, because big real-world projects aren’t done by one individual, I see myself actively sharing ideas, prototyping, problem-solving with a team, and learning from experts across disciplines like materials science, sustainability, and electrical systems. More academically, I plan to pursue a PhD in robotics after realizing how much more there is to learn from every field that involves robotics.

My motto, redefining “impossible" as “I’m possible,” reflects my boldness and perseverance. This grit drives me to keep moving forward, even when facing complex challenges. The world I envision might sound impossible, but that won’t stop me from exploring all possibilities that benefit society in meaningful ways. I see myself continuously studying what’s left unknown in the world. 

Spending over 5,500 hours in my high school robotics machine shop, which was at a mentor’s garage, shaped the engineer I am today. People have told me that my eyes sparkle when I talk about robotics, and honestly, I admit it was a passion that consumed my entire high school life. Moreover, I am passionate not only about building robots but also about spreading awareness of STEM in under-resourced communities. Through the FIRST Robotics Competition, I not only developed fundamental skills in the field of robotics but also witnessed the impact I could make on over thousands of people visiting local fairs by sharing my passions. For this reason, I’m continuing my robotics journey in college, especially through the Cornell Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (CUAUV) project team and by researching at the Cornell Architectural Robotics Lab this coming summer.
